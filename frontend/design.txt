1. Goal
    - Update the UI styling so that:
        a. AllStocks
            i. The user can switch the background color 
            between white and black.
            ii. The underline beneath the stock link disappears
            iii. The font is changed to terminal style 
            iv. A chart is added to the right of the stock price with 
            the stock's current & historical prices.
        b. SingleStock
            i. The user can switch the background color 
            between white and black.
            ii. The font is the exact same as the AllStock 
            page.
            iii. The font is changed to terminal style 
            iv. A chart is added under the stock price with 
            the stock's current & historical prices.
3. Implementation
    - Issues
        a. Where do I start when implementing a chart that 
        tracks the stock's current & historical prices?
            i. The chart should be a separate component
            ii. The chart should be a child component of
            the SingleStock component
            iii. The chart should be a child component of
            the AllStocks component
    - Steps
        a. Create a new file, frontend/src/style.css, to
        hold the styling for the UI.
            i. Style the text in:   
                a. AllStocks
                    i. The stock name
                    ii. The stock price
                b. SingleStock
                    i. The stock name
                    ii. The stock price
        b. Create a new file, frontend/src/components/Charts.js
        to hold the chart component.
            i. Use react-google-charts to create a chart
            ii. Make a simple chart with dummy data.
            iii. Now that you have made it work with dummy data,
            make it work with real data.
                - Right now, just try and render the stocks 
                ticker & price.
