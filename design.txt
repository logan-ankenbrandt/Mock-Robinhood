1. Goal
    - Create a clean and simple Robinhood-like web app that allows 
    the user to view up to date information on a list of tickers. 
    - Stack
        a. Frontend
            i. React Hooks based website to show updated ticker 
            information
        b. Backend
            i. Ticker API which provides ticker information to
            the Node Server
            ii. Node.js server that handles API calls from the Frontend
            to the Ticker API
2. Examples
    - Example #1
        a. Frontend
            i. All Stocks 
                - User opens web app -> sees a list of five tickers 
                that update every second with new new price 
                information
            ii. Individual Stock
                - User opens web app -> sees a list of five tickers 
                that update every second with new new price 
                information -> User clicks on one ticker -> User
                is redirected to a page with the ticker information
        b. Backend
            i. All Stocks
                - User opens web app -> sees a list of five tickers 
                that update every second with new price 
                information -> The ticker data is passed through the
                server where data is being requested and passed 
                every second.
                - The Ticker data (price) is updated within 5% of it's previous
                price. 
                    a. Cyclical
                        i. Up once by 5%, down once by 5% == one cycle
            ii. Individual Stock
                - User opens web app -> sees a list of five tickers 
                that update every second with new new price 
                information -> User clicks on one ticker -> User
                is redirected to a page with the ticker information
                -> The ticker data is passed through the
                server where data is being requested and passed 
                every second.
                - The Ticker data (price) is updated within 5% of it's previous
                price. 
                    a. Cyclical
                        i. Up once by 5%, down once by 5% == one cycle
        c. Ticker API
            - The API needs to update stocks every second
                a. Cyclical
                    i. Up once by 5%, down once by 5% == one cycle
            - Types of data
